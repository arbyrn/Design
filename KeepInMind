"Stop Sabotaging Your Code…Before You Even Code" by Meghan Hebel

1. DRAW OUT YOUR STRUCTURE WITH PEN AND PAPER
Yes, really. It may seem tedious in the beginning but taking the time to plan the architecture of your webpage will save you HOURS in the long run.
This will help you to:
  Pinpoint sections and design elements that are similar and identify most of your classes.
  Identify areas that may be more complicated than they initially seemed.
  Make a list of technology platforms, third-party services, or libraries that you will need to set up and use for the project.

2. ORGANIZE YOUR ASSETS
Color palettes, fonts, images, third-party platforms, and libraries are all things that should be set up before coding begins. There’s nothing more frustrating than getting in the zone, only to realize that one image is sized differently than the other eleven and you have to track down the designer or crop it yourself.
Check the sizing, sort everything in their appropriate folders, link in your source codes, and then move forward.

3. WRITE YOUR HTML FIRST
Write ALL of your HTML before you even think of making things look pretty.

4. PRE-SECTION YOUR CSS
Figure out how you want your CSS organized and implement your essentials (such as clearfix and box-sizing). Over time, you’ll find what works for you but here are two examples (one simple and one more complex) to get started.
  /* Global Elements */
  /* Main Classes */
  /* Navigation */
  /* Footer */
  /* Templates */
  /* Media Queries */

5. KEEP A RUNNING LIST OF BUGS AND TODOS
Once coding commences, you’ll likely come across problem areas that you’re having difficulties debugging. When this happens, you’ll either:
Step away from the computer for at least 20 minutes, or
Move on to something easier to do
When you return to that initial problem, and you WILL have to return to it, those running notes will allow you to hop back on the issue more quickly.
Once you figure out the problem, write the solution down too!
Every so often, reread those notes so that if you come across the problem again, you’ll know exactly how to fix it.
